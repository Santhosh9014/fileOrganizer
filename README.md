# File Organizer Scripts

## Overview
This repository contains two shell scripts designed to help organize files in a directory:

1. **resume_organize.sh**: This script searches for files that contain the word "resume" (case-insensitive) and moves them into a folder named `resume`.
2. **organize.sh**: This script organizes files based on their file extensions, moving them into corresponding folders (e.g., `.txt` files go into a `txt` folder).

## How to Use

### Clone the Repository
To start using the scripts, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Santhosh9014/fileOrganizer.git
cd fileOrganizer
